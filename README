XbmcStarter is a small utility that can be used to start XBMC via its webinterface.

It listens on the same port as XBMC and starts it when there comes a standard json requests.

Tested so far with Yatse for Android and a webbrowser.

Warning: Yatse widget will always start XBMC as it sends periodically requests when there are faulty answers.

You can edit the XBMC path and listening port directly in the source.

Use xbmcStarter in your .xinitrc, eg:

  exec xbmcStarter/xbmcStarter

as last line.
